Based on the [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-bug-corrupts-your-hard-drive-on-seeing-this-files-icon/) article, I have created my own takes on how to deliver the NTFS exploit without making the user suspect it by implementing random activation and bomb timer.

## Creating a standalone executable

Install pyinstaller and execute this command `pyinstaller --noconsole --windowed --onefile ntfsExploit.py` to create a standalone executable running as a background process.

## Disclaimer

I am only creating this for fun. If you accidentally broke your computer, then it is **your own damn fault!**
